# To Do List App

The "To Do List" application represents an Android project developed using Kotlin programming language and Room database technology. It offers users a platform to systematically manage their tasks and schedules. Key components and methodologies integrated into the project include:

Recycler View Implementation: The application utilizes the RecyclerView component to present tasks within a scrollable list, facilitating efficient navigation and display of task information.

Integration of Alert Dialogs: The functionality to add, edit, or delete tasks is facilitated through the integration of Alert Dialogs. These dialog prompts enable users to input task details or confirm actions swiftly and intuitively.

Utilization of Custom Resource Design Files: Custom resource design files are employed within the application to enhance its visual aesthetics and improve user interaction. These files contribute to a cohesive and visually appealing user interface design.

Integration of Room Database Technology: Room, a persistence library provided by Android, is utilized as the local database solution. Through Room, the application ensures the seamless storage and retrieval of task data, thereby guaranteeing persistent availability of task information across app sessions and device reboots.
